# DigitsofInteger
Written in C#. This is a Console App project for a class I am taking.

The goal of this project is to take an input from a user, check the format against the requirements, and ouputs the digits of the number in the terminal with 3 spaces in between.

Utilizes the following:
<ul>
<li>Try/Catch error handling</li>
<li>If/else if/else</li>
<li>For loop</li>
</ul>
